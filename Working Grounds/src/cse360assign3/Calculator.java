/**
 * OrderedIntList class file creates an integer list which can only hold 
 * 10 elements. There is also an option to print out the values in the 
 * list in 2 lines with 5 elements in each line.
 * <p>
 * Each input added into the list is sorted in ascending order based on the 
 * previous inputs in the list. If 0 is used in the beginning, will 
 * accept into the list. There will be no duplicate numbers. If there 
 * are already 10 elements, the system will remove the 10th (the largest) 
 * in an attempt to add any new inputs.
